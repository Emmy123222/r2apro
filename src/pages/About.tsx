              We are a group of believers from diverse denominations, united by
              a passion for missions. We aim to reach out to people everywhere,
              enabling their salvation, rededication, commitment, and
              discipleship. We achieve this by prayerfully seeking and visiting
              mission fields, and partnering with local churches and agencies.
              We present the Gospel message in accordance with the Bible and
              entrust new converts to the care of local missionaries and pastors
              for follow-up and discipleship.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
              All praise and glory be to God Almighty, to whom we belong, for
              granting us the privilege of working alongside Him in reaching out
              to souls. May the fruits of our labor be His alone, forever. Amen.
              We are a group of believers from various denominations, united by
              a passion for missions. Our sole aim is to reach out to souls
              wherever they may be, enabling their salvation, rededication,
              commitment, and discipleship, transforming them into effective
              tools in God's hands. To achieve this, we prayerfully seek and
              visit a mission field each Christmas period. The local mission
              agency or umbrella organization serves as our host. Since 2012, we
              have been privileged to visit several mission fields across
              various states in Nigeria. However, our initial mission efforts,
              born out of a strong passion for soul-winning, began at Kagoro
              Mountains in 2007. Ultimately, we rely on God's provision and
              leverage our individual commitments, as well as the support of
              like-minded individuals, groups, and organizations to fund our
              missions. We present the Gospel message in accordance with the
              Bible and entrust new converts to the care of local missionaries
              and pastors for follow-up and discipleship.
